# PY_SAS_Studio_Custom_Steps: Local Install
If you wish to install this python package (maybe from a branch or main) from source as a local install, run this bash program: [local_install_quick_start.sh](./local_install_quick_start.sh).

Provide an argument containing a virtual environment name.  The virtual environment folder is created at the directory from where you executed the bash program.  Note that after installation, you have to activate this virtual environment.  This is done through the following command:

```
. your_venv_name/bin/activate
```
